# LoginDemoJS
A mini JavaScript-based login system.

This was created in help with a YouTube tutorial.
So far, you can login, using the credentials in "script.js", such as
Username: jim
Password: lewis

Ideally, we would want to move the user data from the script file into a local database, and interface with that database to retrieve data.
