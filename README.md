# LoginDemoJS
A mini JavaScript-based login system.

This was created in help with a YouTube tutorial.
So far, you can login, using the credentials in "script.js", such as

Username: jim

Password: lewis

Ideally, we would want to move the user data from the script file into a local database, and interface with that database to retrieve data.

## How do I try it?

Click here to see a preview:

However, it will most likely not work when you press "Log-in."

To run it fully, download the source code and run "index.html" =)
